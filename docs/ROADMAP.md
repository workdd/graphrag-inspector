# Roadmap

The goal is a viewer that anyone with a graph can use to judge it and to check the answers it
gives. A GraphRAG index is one way a graph arrives; a node table and an edge table are another, and
Apache AGE is a third. None of them is the center of the product.

## Principles

- Communities first. The opening screen is a hierarchy and a table, never a hairball.
- Graphs are deterministic: the same data and filters produce the same picture, computed off the
  main thread and cached.
- Every count on screen is derived from the loaded files and can be checked against them.
- Real data never enters the repository; screenshots use the synthetic sample only.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Scope | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 Foundation (done) | Vite app, data contract, GraphRAG and AGE-export loaders, synthetic sample, integrity checks, overview, community table, report panel, CI, pre-push data check | Sample and a real GraphRAG index both load; counts match an independent script; CI is green |
| M1 Internal graph (done) | Community view with a Cytoscape fcose layout of the selected community: type colors, always-on labels without overlap, neighbour highlighting, relationship-type filter, boundary edges dimmed, "expand neighbouring community" | A 200-entity community renders in under two seconds with readable labels; smoke test in Playwright |
| M2 Community map (done) | Whole dataset as nested compound containers (level 0 ⊃ level 1 ⊃ level 2) with expand/collapse, inter-community edges bundled by weight, layout in a worker and cached per dataset hash | 2,500 entities: collapsed map in one second, one expanded community in two; identical layout on reload |
| M3 Quality and evidence (done) | Per-community conductance and density, size distributions, comparison of two partitions (NMI, ARI, crosstab), text units and documents behind entities and relationships | Metrics match reference implementations on the sample; evidence opens for every GraphRAG 2.x index |
| M4 Release (done) | README in English and Korean, GitHub Pages demo on the sample, CONTRIBUTING, issue templates, CHANGELOG, `npx` launcher | A newcomer follows the README and explores their own index without asking questions |

| M5 Usability (done) | Korean/English interface, PNG and CSV export, shareable view URLs, lazy-loaded views, keyboard navigation for tree and tables | Every screen reads in both languages; smoke test covers the switch |
| M6 Scale and compatibility (done) | 10k-entity synthetic stress set with measured load, graph and map timings; GraphRAG 0.3 `create_final_*` sample tested end to end; covariates (claims) shown; n-hop neighbourhood exploration from any entity | 10k entities load under five seconds, collapsed map under two; 0.3 sample passes the smoke test |
| M7 Distribution (done) | npm package with a `bin` that serves a built copy next to your index; GitHub releases with notes; Dockerfile for static hosting | `npm pack` contains only dist and bin; a release page exists for each tag |
| M8 Ask (current) | Local and global search against an OpenAI-compatible provider; citations that open the record they name; evidence graph, embedding space and a picture of the run itself; saved traces; entity-embedding sidecar tool | A question answered from the shipped sample end to end, with every citation resolving to a record; no key reaches a trace, a log or a build |

| M9 Index diagnosis (done) | Turn the quality numbers into named problems: entities no community claims, one community swallowing a level, communities with no report, modularity that says the grouping does not follow the graph, descriptions too thin to rank on. Each with what it costs a search and what to change upstream | An index with a known defect is opened and the panel names the defect, its effect on local or global search, and the setting to change; every finding is computed from the loaded files and has a test with a fixture that triggers it |
| M10 Local search without Python (current) | Embed the open index from the browser through the configured provider, with the call count and a cost estimate shown before anything starts, progress that can be stopped, and the vectors cached in IndexedDB against the index digest. The sidecar file stays the portable form | A 10k-entity index becomes searchable from a browser with only an API key, the estimate is shown first, a stopped run leaves what it finished, and reopening the index does not embed again |
| M11 Compare | One question answered by both methods side by side, with the evidence sets diffed. Two indexes of the same corpus diffed after re-indexing: entities gained and lost, communities that split or merged | Local and global answers to one question are read together with what only one of them retrieved marked; two exports of one corpus produce a change list that matches an independent script |
| M12 Evaluation runs | A set of questions run in one go against one index, each saved as a trace, with a table of what was retrieved, what was cited, tokens and latency, and a CSV of it. The 24 scenarios already in the repo are the first set | A question set runs unattended, the table names which questions retrieved nothing and which answered without citing, and the run is repeatable from the saved traces |
| M13 Reach | The tab strip as a real tab pattern (one tab stop, arrow keys, panels associated), keyboard paths through the tree and the tables, and the ceiling above 10k entities measured rather than assumed | A screen reader announces the views and their panels; 100k entities either load with measured timings or the app says plainly that they will not |

## Out of scope for now

Live database connections, editing communities, and hosted multi-user deployments. DRIFT search,
dynamic community selection and prompt tuning are deliberately deferred until the two methods that
exist have been measured on real indexes.
